# About

This codebase was created to demonstrate a Node.js server built with **idio-graphql** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more. 

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

> This server exposes [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec compliant rest endpoint's, where subsequent graphql executions are preformed. This will change when there is a suitable frontend [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) application, that executes graphql compliant requests.
